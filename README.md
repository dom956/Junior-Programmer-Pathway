Final submission for the exercise

-Creating a mini project using OOP
Abstraction: reducing duplicate code by “abstracting out” repeated details or information.
Encapsulation: “encapsulating” data and the methods that manipulate that data together in a class, protecting it from misuse by other classes.
Inheritance: child classes deriving (or “inheriting”) behavior from parent classes.
Polymorphism: changing (“morphing”) methods into many (“poly”) forms (i.e., method overloading and method overriding).
